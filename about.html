			<p>This pattern generator tool is inspired by the 17 symmetry types called Pattern formation or mostly known as a wallpaper group. This system is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art, especially in textiles and tiles as well as wallpaper.</p>

			<p>This system of classification allows for an infinite number variation generated with one module. The prime example of it is the Kaba ornament by Bram De Does who utilized this method to make an expansive library of patterns into a 500 page book.</p>

			<p>The template is an abstract interpretation of Bramâ€™s module structure where the identical mirrored negative and positive space creates interesting and surprising instances.</p>

			<p>You can explore this system by adding your own square proportioned module.</p>
